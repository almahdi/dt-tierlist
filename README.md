# DT Tier List

## About the app
This project was created because [DistroTube](https://distro.tube/) said in one of his videos [My Tier List For Tiling Window Managers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xysISs0mcj8) that such app doesn't exist in free and open source form, all of the projects/app that exist are proprietary.

I thought it was a once off video, since I followed DT for a long time, but when he made the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xysISs0mcj8) I had that itch to create a free and open source app that does exactly what he wanted. Instead of using GIMP.

## Local Development

``` sh
# Allow direnv assuming direnv and flakes are enabled.
direnv allow
npm install ## Install npm dependences
npm run start ## Start the dev server
```

### Any other OS

``` sh
npm install
npm run start
```

## Editors used to create the app
* Gitpod used with my Tab S8 Ultra to initiate the project. I usually use my tablet to code on the go.
* Emacs (Doom Emacs) -- Its the ultimate editor of all times.
