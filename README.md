# DT Tier List

## About the app
This project was created because [DistroTube](https://distro.tube/) said in one of his videos (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xysISs0mcj8) that such app doesn't exist in free and open source form, all of the projects/app that exist are proprietary.

I thought it was a once off video, since I followed DT for a long time, but when he made the [second video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xysISs0mcj8) I had that itch to create a free and open source app that does exactly what he wanted. Instead of using GIMP.
